## Key Learnings
### 1. **Dealing with hidden files**
To show all files and directories you can utilise the  `ls -a` command. Commonly files which are hidden utilising the `.` at the beginning of a directory/file are configuration or system files.

### 2. **Basic Linux Commands**
- `cd`: Changes directory.
- `ls -a`: Displays all hidden files/directories.
- `cat`: Display the contents of the file.
